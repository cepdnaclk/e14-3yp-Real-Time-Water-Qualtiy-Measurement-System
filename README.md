## Introduction

The traditional method adopted by environmental authorities in measuring the quality of water is to collect water samples from various locations and send them to the laboratories for for analysis, but this is inefficient and ineffective as it is time consuming, wasting human labour, and not economical. To get a analysis by observing previous records will also be difficult in this technique. If real time monitoring is required, this method is unable to provide expected outcomes as it may not be possible to take samples and send them immediately to the laboratories for analysis.

The system consists of several sensors located in remote locations to measure the water quality real time (most probably near water resources around industrial environments). The information received by sensors are sent to a centralized system which is monitoring the water quality measurement through GSM modules. These information can be sent at a predefined interval of time and they can be analyzed from the central monitoring system. Moreover, this system is only accessed by the authorized personnel only who works at environmental authorities. Hence, the system is secured with access restrictions.
